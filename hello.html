		<h3 id="back"> About Sports</h3>

		<p class="blue">A human activity involving physical exertion and skill as the primary focus of the activity, with elements of competition or social participation where rules and patterns of behaviour governing the activity exist formally through organisations and is generally recognised as a sport.Sport participation is not easily defined and will often depend on how it is perceived by the observer. As a guide, a ‘sport participant’ is a person who takes part in a sporting activity, whether in a formal or informal capacity. Some examples of sport participation can be described by a particular role performed in sport (including playing and non-playing roles), such as an athlete (or player), coach (or trainer, instructor), or official (or umpire, referee). There are many roles in sport, and these can be volunteer or paid. How a person describes their engagement (such as solo or group, impromptu or scheduled, or the place/setting) can also help to determine if their sport participation is organised or not.

		<h3 id="back"> About Lorem Ipsum</h3>

		<p class="blue"> <a href="https://loremipsum.io/">Lorem Ipsum </a> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
